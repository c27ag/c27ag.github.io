	 <h2> 10/4: </h2>
	<p> today i worked on my home page of my website, and finished up the design </p>

	 <h2> 10/6: </h2>

	<p> today we made our first projects of the website! i worked on an animation, and linked it to my projects page </p>

	 <h2> 10/25: </h2>

	<p> today we started making jumpscare projects for halloween. i am going to make an animation with cute dogs that leads into a creepy photo with a creepy audio </p>

	 <h2> 10/27üç∞: </h2>

	<p> today we had a very calm class where we worked on our jumpscares. it was also my birthday!</p>

	 <h2> 10/30: </h2>

	<p> we watched a video about event listeners. i came up with a question: what types of event listeners are there? </p>

	 <h2> 11/1: </h2>

	<p> i finished my jumpscare and added it to my website </p>

	 <h2> 11/8: </h2>

	<p> we learned how to make images multiply. i made a bubble popping project where when you click on a bubble, it makes a sound and turns into a rubber duck </p>

	<h2> 11/15: </h2>

	<p> we got introduced to our upcoming project which is gratitude cards! i started working on mine, and i'm making it for my sister </p>

	<h2> 11/17: </h2>

	<p> i finished my gratitude card today. in this project, i made each box into a div, and put a different photo into each one. i used an event listener to make it so that if you press the keys, different photos show up. i used the click counter and opacity so that if you click once, one photo will show up, and if you click again, it will disappear, and another one will show up next to it. i also made this a loop.

	<h2> 1/10: </h2>

	<p> today was our first class back from winter break! we made a project where if you click on the screen, it generates a random name from a list. the list is of tv shows, so you can find a show to watch. we added strings and worked with variables. next time, i want to add photos to correspond to each show. i will work on the aestheics. </p>

	<h2> 2/16: </h2>

	<p> today i linked my slideshow to my about me page. previously, i made an array, which generated a random tv show at each click. i also made a project for my dog, where you can move her around the key with the arrow keys. i am currently working on my valentines project.

	<h2> 2/21: </h2>

	<p> i updated my website today to add my finished projects. i made a project where you can click around the screen to get different shades of different colors by using rgb. i also finished my valentines day project! </p>

	<h2> 2/23: </h2>

	<p> today we talked a lot about color and color codes. here are my four questions on the topic:
		<li> 1. how do color blind glasses work? </li>
		<li> 2. how do other animals see color? </li>
		<li> 3. do we all see color differently? </li>
		<li> 4. who decided that certain colors mean certain things? ex. red is a warning, yellow indicates happiness, blue means sadness, etc. </li> </p>

	<h2> 2/28: </h2>

	<p> today we worked on fixing anything we needed to. if there was something we were unhappy with on our website, we changed it to make it to our liking. </p>

	<h2> 5/17: </h2>

	<p> i haven't written in here in so long, so here are some updates! alexandra and i are currently working on our final project. we are making a cookbook with recipes that we both made, and we give our ratings as well as what we could have done better. our goal at the start of this project was to improve on our cooking, since we both were not the best. this project has made us better chefs overall, and made us realize how fun cooking is. we learned some really important and fundamental kitchen skills which will always be helpful. this project is super fun, and i am so glad we got to do this. </p>
